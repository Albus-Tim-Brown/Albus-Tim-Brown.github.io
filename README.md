# What is it

This is a blog project that has already gone live, built by **Tim Brown**. 

The front of the project uses "**Hexo**", a blog secondary development platform, as well as some open source frameworks. 

The back-end management uses the "**Spring Boot**" framework, uses the "**MySQL**" database to manage blog data, integrates the database persistence layer framework "**Mybatis Plus**", uses the security framework "**Spring Security**", uses the token management "**JWT**", uses the **markdown** document integration editor, uses the cache storage "**Redis**", etc.

In order to prevent attacks, access to the backend management system and commenting functions has been disabled, and the website's configuration files do not contain any backend content and other related third-party API access. At present, the project is built using a purely static web page.

# How to use

Websites that head here can quickly build static blogs:

 https://hexo.io/zh-cn/index.html

If you use "Hexo" directly, the blog you build is not easy to manage, it is recommended to build a back-end program to manage it. For example, use the "Spring Boot" framework developed based on the Java language.



# How to publish

If you're using Github, just follow the tutorial inside "Hexo". You can even target your own blog site using your own domain name.



# Can do

You can:
1. Clone the entire project, but this project is generated with "Hexo", it is not recommended to do this;
2. Check the blog post, but it is recommended to go directly to the website to view, the address is: https://albus-tim-brown.github.io/
3. Make suggestions, which can be blog-related suggestions, such as article content, blog layout, etc.;
4. Other types of effective advice.

1. Posting meaningless content in the blog;
